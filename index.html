  <div>Economic realities are transforming ideas about gender roles, relationships and ideal family size. Rising costs and shifting social norms are having a marked effect on perceptions about when and whether to get married, when and how many children to have, and who is involved in such decisions. Increasingly, women play an important role both in and out of the home, with traditionally gendered roles of ‘provider’ and ‘caregiver’ becoming ever more blurred.</div>

<div>Mass and social media consumption is increasing and together with education and urbanization constitute a powerful modernizing influence that has helped form a more liberal and progressive younger generation.</div>
<div style="padding-top:20px;"></div>
<div>In India, while marriage remains the norm, subtle shifts in power dynamics are reflected in delaying marriage and pregnancy to pursue educational and/or professional goals. Earlier, while having more children was a sign of prosperity and stability, women, especially in India, are increasingly seeking to have smaller families. Public health campaigns that discourage marriage before 18 and childbirth before 21 have also driven this shift.</div>
<div style="padding-top:20px;"></div>
<div>Attitudes are shifting towards a more inclusive gender mix. In India, this is reflected in shifting family structures that are being spurred by a more liberal younger generation. There is growing recognition that girls should also be educated. Government schemes are promoting this, which has led to decreased gender bias.</div>

  <div>Women now play an important role in both the home and the outside. In Kenya, a large number of women express the need and desire to be self reliant owing to the fast-changing roles of men and women within the community.

Most women want better lives, primarily to safeguard the health and welfare of their children. </div>

<div>The perception that men are less responsible than in previous generations has reinforced the desire for self-sufficiency amongst Kenyan women. Women raising children on their own without the obligations of marriage is becoming more prevalent. Furthermore, having multiple sex partners - even in marriage - is becoming common. The economic volatility that most people experience is also leading to the rise of new kinds of plural relationships. Many of these might have a functional or transactional ambit.</div>
